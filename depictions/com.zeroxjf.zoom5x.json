The button, label, haptics, dial snapping, and tap handling are all handled by Apple's native code \u2014 the tweak just adds one more point to the list.\n\nThe tweak dynamically reads the device's actual-to-display zoom factor ratio from the existing zoom points and computes the correct AVFoundation videoZoomFactor for the 5x button. This means it works on any device regardless of the internal zoom factor scale.",

Image quality will be reduced compared to an optical 5x.\n- **iPhone 14 and earlier** (no telephoto or 2x telephoto): Same as above \u2014 5x is digital zoom.\n- The 15x max-zoom button (digital) is preserved and unaffected.",
